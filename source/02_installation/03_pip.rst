Installation with pip
=====================

Requirements
============

Some requirements are needed to install with pip:

* python 2.6 or 2.7 (recommended)
* python-dev
* pip
* setuptools

**Note** that Python 2.6 will very soon be deprecated and Alignak is targeted to run with Python 2.7.

**Note** that those required libraries will not be installed with the Alignak pip package.

Installation
============

The installation is very simple, use this command::

    sudo pip install alignak
